## 1. Introduction

Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a method used to retrieve images from a large database based on their visual features such as color, texture, or shape rather than text-based labels.  

In this project, we aim to design a CBIR system for **Chest X-ray images** using **Histogram** and **Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)** features. These features help identify intensity patterns and texture properties in medical images, which are useful for finding similar X-rays in diagnostic systems.


## 2. Problem Definition

Medical image databases contain thousands of X-rays, and finding similar cases manually is difficult and time-consuming.  
This project focuses on developing a system that automatically retrieves similar Chest X-ray images based on extracted visual features.

## 3. Objective
To design and implement a CBIR system for Chest X-rays using Histogram and GLCM features for efficient and accurate image retrieval.

## 4. Methodology 

1. **Dataset Collection:**  
   - Collect Chest X-ray images from online sources such as Kaggle or NIH Dataset.  
   - Resize all images to a fixed resolution (e.g., 256Ã—256).

2. **Preprocessing:**  
   - Convert images to grayscale (if not already).  
   - Normalize pixel values between 0 and 1.

3. **Feature Extraction (To be done in next report):**  
   - Extract Histogram features.  
   - Extract GLCM texture features (contrast, energy, homogeneity, correlation).

4. **Feature Storage:**  
   - Save extracted features in a CSV or NumPy file for faster retrieval.

5. **Image Retrieval:**  
   - Compare query image features with stored features using a distance measure (e.g., Euclidean distance).  
   - Display top matching images.
